Most recently, I worked as a Computational Biologist at [Foundation Medicine](https://www.foundationmedicine.com/info/detail/our-story), where I contributed to the development of a new cancer diagnostic. Prior to that, I was a postdoctoral fellow in [Dr. Vijay Sankaran's lab](https://www.bloodgenes.org/) at  Boston Children's Hospital and The Broad Institute. There, I leveraged large-scale biobank data to identify novel genetic risk loci underlying risk associated with myeloid malignancies, particularly myeloproliferative neoplasms. 

I earned my PhD in [Genetics](https://gsbs.tufts.edu/academics/basic-science-phd-programs/mammalian-genetics-jax) from The Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, conducting my dissertation work in [Dr. Beth Dumont](https://www.jax.org/research-and-faculty/faculty/beth-dumont)'s lab at The Jackson Laboratory. My [thesis](https://www.proquest.com/openview/f98d21182232df1e636236a765855d6d/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y) focussed on the evolutionary dynamics of centromere DNA and associated kinetochore proteins, exploring their implications for chromosome segregation dynamics and genome stability. 

I hold a B.S. in Psychobiology and Marine Biology from the University of California, Los Angeles. I was involved in empathy research in Dr. Matthew Lieberman’s [Social Cognitive Neuroscience Lab](https://www.uclascnlab.com/), as well as vertebrate morphology research in [Dr. Blaire Van Valkenburgh’s lab](https://sites.lifesci.ucla.edu/eeb-vanvalkenburgh/blaire/).
