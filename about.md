Most recently, I was a Computational Biologist at [Foundation Medicine](https://www.foundationmedicine.com/info/detail/our-story) working on a new product. Before that, I was a postdoctoral fellow in [Dr. Vijay Sankaran's lab](https://www.bloodgenes.org/) at  Boston Children's Hospital and The Broad Institute working on harnessing large-scale biobank populations to identify novel risk loci underlying risk for developing myeloid malignancies, in parituclar Myeloproliferative Neoplasms. I got my PhD in [Genetics](https://gsbs.tufts.edu/academics/basic-science-phd-programs/mammalian-genetics-jax) from The Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and did my research in [Dr. Beth Dumont's lab](https://www.jax.org/research-and-faculty/research-labs/the-dumont-lab) at The Jackson Laboratory.
I have a BS in Psychobiology and Marine Biology from the University of California - Los Angeles.
