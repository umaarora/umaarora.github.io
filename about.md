Most recently, I was a Computational Biologist at [Foundation Medicine](https://www.foundationmedicine.com/info/detail/our-story) working on a new cancer diagnostic. Prior to that, I was a postdoctoral fellow in [Dr. Vijay Sankaran's lab](https://www.bloodgenes.org/) at  Boston Children's Hospital and The Broad Institute working on harnessing large-scale biobank populations to identify novel risk loci underlying risk for developing myeloid malignancies, in parituclar Myeloproliferative Neoplasms. I got my PhD in [Genetics](https://gsbs.tufts.edu/academics/basic-science-phd-programs/mammalian-genetics-jax) from The Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and did my research in [Dr. Beth Dumont](https://www.jax.org/research-and-faculty/faculty/beth-dumont)'s lab at The Jackson Laboratory. My [thesis](https://www.proquest.com/openview/f98d21182232df1e636236a765855d6d/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y) investigated the evolutionary dynamics of centromere DNA and associated kinetochore proteins and it's implications on chromosome segregation dynamics and genome stability. I got my BS in Psychobiology and Marine Biology from the University of California - Los Angeles.
