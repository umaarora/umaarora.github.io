Even though this study abroad program only lasted six weeks, it was easily one of the best experiences of my life. I got to check off some incredible places from my travel list: North Stradbroke Island → Brisbane → Gladstone → Heron Island → Cairns → Sydney — and every stop had its own kind of magic.

We kicked things off living on North Stradbroke Island, just off the coast of Brisbane. Mornings started with sunshine blasting through the windows and hundreds of birds chirping at 5 a.m. — nature's very effective alarm clock. We swam at nearly every beach on the island, and most of our days were filled with fieldwork: collecting samples, seining the shallows, running after ghost crabs (one poor guy named ET had a whole squad of us chasing him), and laughing like kids when something cool turned up in the net.


For our research project, my partner and I studied the feeding behavior of a fish called the leatherjacket — it actually changes color based on what it eats! We designed an experiment that fit into our 3-week timeline, caught the fish ourselves with hand nets, and made these weird little “seagrass jelly pancakes” to test their preferences. It was such a mix of creativity, problem-solving, and actual marine science. We even had to let our study fish go after we were done — a bittersweet moment (and yes, some tears were shed).

Also — straight-faced whiskey shots may have been involved to celebrate an A.

During our day trip to Brisbane, we visited the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary where I got to hold a koala (!!) and hand-feed kangaroos. One of the most unexpectedly magical things I saw was a girl playing the ukulele to a group of kangaroos — and they were literally bobbing their heads to the rhythm. No joke.


After that, we ferried out to Heron Island, this tiny coral cay on the southern end of the Great Barrier Reef that you could literally walk around in 20 minutes. It felt like we had dropped off the edge of the map. The beaches were so white they hurt your eyes in the daytime, and the reef life was unreal — turtles, parrotfish, reef sharks, stingrays, shovelnose guitarfish, and coral as far as the eye could see.


I got to dive on the reef, which was incredible, and snorkel every day just steps from where we slept. We even witnessed a sea turtle nesting at night — one of the most awe-inspiring, quiet moments I’ve ever had in nature. We spent the week finishing up our research projects and writing full scientific reports, all while still managing to sneak in daily sea creature sightings and a hilarious reenactment Thanksgiving dinner with everyone playing classic family roles.

Our last official stop was Gladstone, where we wrapped up the program with a group taco night and a very spirited rendition of The Sound of Music, complete with wine, lederhosen impressions, and slightly chaotic singing.

After the program ended, a few of us headed up to Cairns, where I got to dive the Great Barrier Reef again, this time off the coast. We also went white water rafting — I did fall out of the boat — and saw crocodiles in the rainforest. I (mostly) climbed Mt. Sorrow and finally ended the trip in Sydney, where I stayed with a high school friend. We took selfies with the Opera House, hiked the Blue Mountains, found ocean blowholes, and roamed the city’s small cafes and shops like locals.


Australia is an absolutely stunning place — the beaches, the food, the people, the marine life, the greenery, even the birds at 5 a.m. I’d go back in a heartbeat. But what made this trip more than just travel was the science. We weren’t just tourists; we were researchers — designing experiments, collecting and analyzing real data, writing up findings, and learning how to work closely with partners in unfamiliar and often hilarious conditions.

Looking back, this trip didn’t just teach me how to be a better biologist — it showed me how fun and meaningful research could be. From jelly pancake experiments to underwater transects, it stoked my passion for asking questions about the natural world and gave me the confidence that I could actually find the answers. A truly unforgettable way to kick off senior year.
